  description:
    'I am a software engineer with over 10 years of experience in the field. I have worked in various companies and projects, from small startups to large corporations. I am pragmatic, never dogmatic and always open to debate. Although writing and pushing code to production is my daily activity, I excel in design and I am very receptive in translating user pain-points into smooth user journeys. I am a team player and I enjoy mentoring junior members of the team. I am a strong advocate for mental health and I am always looking for ways to make the tech industry a more supportive place.<br/><br/>My mother tongue is Italian. I speak and write fluently in English and I understand at amateur level Portuguese, Spanish and Greek.',
